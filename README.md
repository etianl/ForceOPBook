<p>This requires<strong> Creative Mode</strong> for you to make the illegal book! The books are by default a book and quill that appears blank.. </p>
  <p><strong>After making the Book and Quill give it to an operator and have them click on the first blank page to start typing. This will close the book window and the command will execute.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>THE COMMAND WILL BE EXECUTED BY THE TARGET PLAYER, THEY MUST HAVE A HIGH ENOUGH PERMISSION LEVEL (Or must be Operator)!</strong></p>

Using Books to gain OP status is a very old method. This is not an original idea!

## Features:
- The **"ForceOP"** mode gives you operator status. When this mode is selected the command text field will not be used.
- The **"AnyCommand"** allows you to specify your own command.
- The **"WritableBook"** option **(ONLY AVAILABLE ON MC SERVERS v1.21.2 or GREATER)** makes a Book and Quill item which can be easily used to ask someone for an autograph.
- The **"WrittenBook"** option **(Available on all server versions)** creates a Written book that has been signed and has a title and author. These will require a little more social engineering to be used effectively.
